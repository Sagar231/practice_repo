                                            It is said that the Goddess Vaishno Devi is a manifestation of the Goddess Mahalaxmi. The temple is located in the Trikuta Mountains in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The temple itself has located about 13.5 km from the city center of Katra and
                                            one can travel to the temple on foot, or hire ponies, electric vehicles and even palanquins which carry two to four people. They will take you as far as Bhawan. It is one of the best experiences you will ever
                                            have and the scenic beauty en route is truly mesmerizing. For those who cannot or do not want to go through the road can also hire the helicopter services with a drop off at Sanjhichhat, which is 9.5 km higher
                                            than Katra. For those who wish to travel on foot, the pilgrimage is said to be one of the most grueling ones and it is believed that the hardship is a sign of spiritual cleansing. The shrine itself is located
                                            at a height of 5300 feet and one has to climb up steep hills and cliffs which require a lot of endurance. Pilgrims believe that all wishes are granted when one offers their prayers at the shrine and pay their
                                            respects to the Goddess.

Katra Bhairav is considered to be a tantric according to Hindu mythology.
                                                    It is believed that Bhairav followed Vaishno Devi and was just about to attack her when she took the form of Kali and beheaded him. When he realized that the goddess was not any ordinary girl, he begged
                                                    for forgiveness and accepted that he thought of attacking her only in order to attain salvation.

Originating from the southern slope of the Shivalik Range of Himalayas, Ban Ganga
                                                    River has two ghats where a large number of Hindu devotees take a holy dip. The river is an important tributary of the Chenab River and got its name from two words, Ban meaning Arrow and Ganga which
                                                    stands for sacred river of India, Ganges. Thus, the river is also called the twin of Ganges.

                                                        found out about this cave, legend has it that the Goddess used her trident at the other end of the cave to create an opening, which lead to the Bhavan (or the main shrine). When Bhairavnath followed
                                                        her there, she took the form of Mahakali and beheaded him. Today, this cave acts as a stopover for the pilgrims on their journey up to the Bhavan. There is a long queue leading to a narrow opening
                                                        at the base of the rock wall, through which one has to crawl for a few minutes to reach the other side. A large shrine dedicated to the three Goddesses--Kali, Laxmi and Saraswati is also built here.
                                                        The darshan route is semicircular, so that you exit from a different opening at a small distance from the entry route.
